These webpages apply quantitative methods to a number of applied problems. The analyses are separated into categories based on quantitative technique. Categories were chosen because of their application to specific types of problems, although there is obviously significant overlap across categories. 

Methodologies include machine learning algorithms, Bayesian statistical techniques, experimental and quasi-experimental methods, and mathematical models. 

Each webpage contains an analysis written in [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) with corresponding R scripts located [here](https://github.com/dincerti/dincerti.github.io/tree/master/r). The entire site is generated from plain text Markdown and HTML using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The repository for the site can be found [here](https://github.com/dincerti/dincerti.github.io).
