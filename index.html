                    <p> Hi, and welcome to my website! I am a health economist who works at the intersection of economics and data science. </p>
                    
    <p>My primary research focus is the estimation and simulation of statistical models from observational and clinical trial data and its implications for decision making. Applications include comparative and cost-effectiveness analysis of health technologies, outcomes research, and pharmaceutical R&amp;D support. I am a proponent of expanded use of data science tools in health economics and develop the R package, <a href = "https://hesim-dev.github.io/hesim/">hesim</a>, for health economic simulation modeling.</p>
                    
			   <p> In my free time, I enjoy spending as much time as possible with my wife Jennifer. In my pre-PhD life, I was a rather unsuccessful collegiate baseball player at UC San Diego
					whose career was cut short by a shoulder injury. I still enjoy trying to relive my days as an athlete by playing sports when my shoulder permits (usually basketball). 
					I also somehow enjoy lifting up heavy objects and then putting them back down. </p>
