                    <p> Hi, and welcome to my website! I am a health economist who works at the intersection of economics, data science, and policy analysis. 
					My substantive interests include the economic evaluation of health technologies, income and health inequalities, rising health costs, and optimal health insurance design. 
					</p>
					<p> My current work focuses largely on estimating the value of new health technologies and determining how health systems should allocate resources. I specialize in applying data science and computing techniques to health care and public policy. Recently, I have been developing R/C++ health-economic simulation models and a number of interactive web applications. Occasionally, I write blog posts on statistical and machine learning techniques that I've learned in the hope that they will be useful to someone else.

			   <p> In my free time, I enjoy spending as much time as possible with my wife Jennifer. In my pre-PhD life, I was a rather unsuccessful collegiate baseball player at UC San Diego
					whose career was cut short by a shoulder injury. I still enjoy trying to relive my days as an athlete by playing sports when my shoulder permits (usually basketball). 
					I also somehow enjoy lifting up heavy objects and then putting them back down. </p>
