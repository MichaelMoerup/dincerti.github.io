                    <p> Hi, and welcome to my website! I'm a quantitative social scientist with a PhD in Public Policy from Princeton University who loves working with data 
					and is fascinated by the health and life sciences industry.
					I try to bring these two passions together by using mathematical and statistical models to provide actionable insights that ultimately improve
					human health and well-being. 
					</p>
					<p>  I'm extremely curious and always thinking about ways in which data can be used to solve real world problems. This site shares some of the things 
					I've learned about using data to answer questions across a range of health related areas like clinical medicine, epidemiology, healthcare delivery,
					business strategy, public policy, and politics. 
					The <a href="analytics.html">analytics</a> portion of the site provides code showing how to apply a number of different data science techniques to substantive
					issues.
					
			        <p> My interest in health stems partly from my enjoyment of sports and the outdoors. In my pre-PhD life, I was a rather unsuccessful collegiate baseball player at UC San Diego
					whose career was cut short by a shoulder injury. I still enjoy trying to relive
					my days as an athlete by playing sports when my shoulder permits (usually basketball). I also somehow enjoy lifting up heavy objects and then putting them back down. </p>
