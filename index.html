                    <p> Hi, and welcome to my website! I am a quantiative social scientist with a PhD in <a href = "https://www.princeton.edu/~pegrad/wwsreq.html"> Political
					Economy </a> from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, where I conducted 
					<a href="cv.html#research_papers">research</a> in political economy,
					health economics, and public policy. Topics that I worked on included optimal health insurance design, political campaign strategy, 
					the impact of political instability on stock prices in emerging markets, and disparities in health outcomes. 
					</p>
					<p>  I am extremely curious and love using data to tackle real world social science questions. This site shares some of the quantitative methods I've learned
					(Bayesian statistics, machine learning, causal inference, etc) and applies them to a number of areas that interest me like politics, public policy, 
					health care, and sports. The analyses---with fully integrated code---can be found in the <a href="analytics.html">analytics</a> portion of the site.
					
			        <p> In my free time, I enjoy spending as much time as possible with my fianc&eacutee Jennifer. In my pre-PhD life, I was a rather unsuccessful collegiate baseball player at UC San Diego
					whose career was cut short by a shoulder injury. I still enjoy trying to relive my days as an athlete by playing sports when my shoulder permits (usually basketball). 
					I also somehow enjoy lifting up heavy objects and then putting them back down. </p>
