					<h3 style="margin-top:0"> About Me </h3>
                    <p>I'm a multidisciplinary health services researcher with a passion for health analytics and a PhD in Public Policy from Princeton University. 
					I combine substantive expertise in health care with mathematical and statistical modeling for the purpose of improving health outcomes and reducing costs.  
					</p>
					  <p> I am, in general, interested in using data to help make decisions that ultimately impact patient health and well-being. The 
						<a href="analytics.html">analytics</a> portion of this website shows how a number of different quantitative tools can be used for these purposes. My experience 
						includes estimating the cost-effectiveness of treatments, predicting the outcomes of public policies, and determining how health care organizations should 
						allocate their resources.
					</p>
					  <p> I also view political analysis as an important component of health analytics as political actors are ultimately responsible for implementing health care
					  legislation. My experiences in this area range from forecasting elections and calculating optimal campaign strategies to quantifying the impact that political events
					  have on stock prices.					  
					</p>
                    <p> My interest in health stems partly from my enjoyment of sports and the outdoors. In my pre-PhD life, I was a rather unsuccessful collegiate baseball player at UC San Diego
					whose career was cut short by a shoulder injury. I still enjoy trying to relive
					my days as an athlete by playing sports when my shoulder permits (usually basketball). I also somehow enjoy lifting up heavy objects and then putting them back down. </p>
