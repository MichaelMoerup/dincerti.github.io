                    <p> Hi, and welcome to my website! I am a health economist who works at the intersection of economics, data science, and policy analysis. </p>
                    
    <p>My research is concerned with two main questions. First, how should health care resources be allocated in a given policy context. Second, how should health systems be designed so that health care resources are optimally allocated? Much of my current research consequently focuses on cost-effectiveness analysis, estimating the burden of disease, and understanding how public policy can align medical costs with the benefits of care. I am particularly interested in the methodological tools needed to answer these questions including simulation modeling, causal inference, Bayesian statistics, and econometric techniques more generally.</p>
                    
			   <p> In my free time, I enjoy spending as much time as possible with my wife Jennifer. In my pre-PhD life, I was a rather unsuccessful collegiate baseball player at UC San Diego
					whose career was cut short by a shoulder injury. I still enjoy trying to relive my days as an athlete by playing sports when my shoulder permits (usually basketball). 
					I also somehow enjoy lifting up heavy objects and then putting them back down. </p>
