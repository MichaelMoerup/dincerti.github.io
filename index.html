                    <p> Hi, and welcome to my website! I am a health economist who works at the intersection of economics, data science, and policy analysis. 
					My substantive interests include the economic evaluation of health technologies, income and health inequalities, rising health costs, optimal health insurance design, and  sport science. 
					</p>
					<p>  I also love learning new methodological techniques and using data to tackle real world problems. This site shares some of the quantitative methods I've learned
					(Bayesian statistics, machine learning, causal inference, etc) and applies them to a number of areas that interest me like politics, public policy, 
					health care, and sports. The analyses---with fully integrated code---can be found in the <a href="analytics.html">analytics</a> portion of the site.
					
			        <p> In my free time, I enjoy spending as much time as possible with my fianc&eacutee Jennifer. In my pre-PhD life, I was a rather unsuccessful collegiate baseball player at UC San Diego
					whose career was cut short by a shoulder injury. I still enjoy trying to relive my days as an athlete by playing sports when my shoulder permits (usually basketball). 
					I also somehow enjoy lifting up heavy objects and then putting them back down. </p>
