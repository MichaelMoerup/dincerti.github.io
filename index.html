					<h2 class="text-primary"> About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a PhD candidate in political economy at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University expecting to defend my dissertation 
					this September. My research focuses on the health care industry and health care policy. I have academic training in a number of related areas including microeconomic theory,
					statistics, health economics, epidemiology, demography, and political economy. </p>
					<p> I am generally interested in identifying the most effective ways for societies to maximize the health and well being of its citizens. 
					Some of the questions that I am currently thinking about include:
					<ul>
					<li>How should we design health insurance so that individuals get necessary care and are sufficiently protected from financial risk, but do 
					not spend too inefficiently due to moral hazard?
					<li>How can data science and statistical modeling be used to improve health care delivery and/or the cost-effectiveness of health care?
					<li>Why are there substantial differences in health outcomes across OECD countries and can understanding these differences inform public policy? 
					<li>Why are there large disparities in health care within the United States and how can we minimize them? 
					</ul>
					</p>
                    <p> My interest in health stems partly from my enjoyment of sports and the outdoors. In my pre-PhD life, I was a rather unsuccessful collegiate baseball player whose career was cut short by a shoulder injury. I still enjoy trying to relive
					my days as an athlete by playing sports when my shoulder permits (usually basketball). I also somehow enjoy lifting up heavy objects and then putting them back down. </p>
