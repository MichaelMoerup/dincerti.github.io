					<h2> About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a PhD candidate in <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~pegrad/wwsreq.html">political economy</a> at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University expecting to defend my dissertation 
					this September. I have academic training in microeconomic theory, statistics, political economy and a number of health related fields including health economics, 
					epidemiology, and demography. </p>
					<p> I enjoy using quantitative methods to answer applied questions in a number of areas such as business, public policy, politics, sports, and health. 
					In my current research, I study public policy issues---especially in healthcare---from economic and political perspectives.  
					Some of the questions that I am currently thinking about include:
					<ul>
					<li>How should we design health insurance so that individuals get necessary care and are sufficiently protected from financial risk, but do 
					not spend too inefficiently due to moral hazard?
					<li>How can data science and statistical modeling be used to improve health care delivery and/or the cost-effectiveness of health care?
					<li>Why are there differences in health outcomes across and within OECD countries
					and can understanding these differences inform public policy?  
					</ul>
					</p>
                    <p> My interest in health stems partly from my enjoyment of sports and the outdoors. In my pre-PhD life, I was a rather unsuccessful collegiate baseball player at UC San Diego
					whose career was cut short by a shoulder injury. I still enjoy trying to relive
					my days as an athlete by playing sports when my shoulder permits (usually basketball). I also somehow enjoy lifting up heavy objects and then putting them back down. </p>
