                    <p>I am a PhD candidate in political economy at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University expecting to defend my dissertation 
					this September. My research focuses on the health care industry and health care policy. I have methodological training in a number of related areas including microeconomic theory,
					statistics, health economics, epidemiology, demography, and political economy. </p>
					<p> The questions that I am most passionate about include:
					<ul>
					<li>What types of statistical analyses are most appropriate for assessing the cost-effectiveness of health care?
					<li>How can data science be used to improve health care delivery?
					<li>Why are there substantial differences in life expectancy across OECD countries and can understanding these differences inform public policy? 
					<li>Why are there large disparities in health care within the United States and how can we minimize them? 
					</ul>
					</p>
                    <p> My interest in health stems partly from my enjoyment of sports and the outdoors. In my pre-PhD life, I was a rather unsuccessful collegiate baseball player whose career was cut short by a shoulder injury. I still enjoy trying to relive
					my days as an athlete by playing sports when my shoulder permits (usually basketball). I also somehow enjoy lifting up heavy objects and then putting them back down. </p>
