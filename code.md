### [hesim](http://devinincerti.com/hesim/)
`hesim` is an package for fast health-economic simulation modeling. It can currently be used for conducting Bayesian cost-effectiveness analysis (e.g. summarize probabilistic sensitivity analyses) at the subgroup level. It is under development and new functionality for efficiently simulating and analyzing health-economic models is being added. ([website](http://devinincerti.com/hesim/))

### [Skeletal Dysplasias](http://104.131.159.61:3838/skeletal-dysplasias/)
An R [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) web application that aids diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias based on clinical features ([link](http://104.131.159.61:3838/skeletal-dysplasias/)). A tutorial supplementing our RSNA education exhibit can be found [here](code/skeletal-dysplasias.html).
