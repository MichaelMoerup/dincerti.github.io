These webpages contain code related to my [research](cv.html#research_papers) and other topics that interest me. The webpages were created dynamically using [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). The entire site is generated from plain text Markdown and HTML using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

The repository for the site can be found [here](https://github.com/dincerti/dincerti.github.io). The R markdown (.Rmd) files call external R scripts which can be found [here]().
