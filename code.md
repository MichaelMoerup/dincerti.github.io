### [hesim](https://innovationvalueinitiative.github.io/hesim/)
`hesim` is an R package for health economic simulation modeling and decision analysis that provides a general framework for integrating statistical analyses with economic evaluation. The package currently supports N-state partitioned survival models and state-transition models, as well as individualized cost-effectiveness analysis. It is designed for high performance simulation modeling including microsimulation and probabilistic sensitivity analysis with core code written in C++ ([Website](https://innovationvalueinitiative.github.io/hesim/)).

### IVI-NSCLC Model
The IVI-NSCLC model is an open-source simulation model for assessing the value of sequences of treatment to treat patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). You can can interact with the model in a number of ways:

* [iviNSCLC R package](https://innovationvalueinitiative.github.io/IVI-NSCLC/): an R package for running the IVI-NSCLC model.
* [IVI-NSCLC basic interface](https://vt-nsclc.clarityviz.com/): a general audience web application allowing those who are not experts in health economics to run the model and learn more about value assessment.
* [IVI-NSCLC advanced interface](https://et-nsclc.clarityviz.com/): a web application that allows users full control over the model for performing cost-effectiveness and multi-criteria decision analyses.

### [IVI-RA Model](https://innovationvalueinitiative.github.io/IVI-RA)
The IVI-RA model is an open-source individual patient simulation for assessing the value of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. You can interact with the model in a number of ways:

* [iviRA package](https://innovationvalueinitiative.github.io/IVI-RA): an R package for running the model.
* [IVI-RA Model Interface](https://innovationandvalueinitiative.shinyapps.io/ivi-ra-expert/): An R Shiny web interface for running the model online with full control over treatments, the patient population, model parameters, model structures, and time horizon.
* [IVI-RA Value Tool](https://innovationandvalueinitiative.shinyapps.io/ivi-ra/): An R Shiny web application providing a more streamlined experience for users with less experience in decision-analytic modeling and rheumatoid arthritis.

### [Skeletal Dysplasias](http://104.131.159.61:3838/skeletal-dysplasias/)
An R [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) web application that aids diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias based on clinical features ([link](http://104.131.159.61:3838/skeletal-dysplasias/)). A tutorial supplementing our RSNA education exhibit can be found [here](code/skeletal-dysplasias.html).

### [Survival Distributions](http://104.131.159.61:3838/survival-curves/)
Plots of parametric survival distributions ([link](http://104.131.159.61:3838/survival-curves/)). Details on distributions used in R can be found [here](code/survival-distributions.html).
