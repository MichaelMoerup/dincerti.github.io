### [IVI-RA model](https://innovationvalueinitiative.github.io/IVI-RA)
The IVI-RA model is an open-source individual patient simulation for assessing the value of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. You can interact with the model in a number of ways:

* [iviRA package](https://innovationvalueinitiative.github.io/IVI-RA): an R package for running the model.
* [IVI-RA Model Interface](https://innovationandvalueinitiative.shinyapps.io/ivi-ra-expert/): An R Shiny web interface for running the model online with full control over treatments, the patient population, model parameters, model structures, and time horizon.
* [IVI-RA Value Tool](https://innovationandvalueinitiative.shinyapps.io/ivi-ra/): An R Shiny web application providing a more streamlined experience for users with less experience in decision-analytic modeling and rheumatoid arthritis.

### [hesim](https://innovationvalueinitiative.github.io/hesim/)
`hesim` is an R package for health economic simulation modeling and decision analysis. The package can help facilitate computationally intensive simulation modeling and be used to analyze the output of simulation models. ([website](https://innovationvalueinitiative.github.io/hesim/))

### [Skeletal Dysplasias](http://104.131.159.61:3838/skeletal-dysplasias/)
An R [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) web application that aids diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias based on clinical features ([link](http://104.131.159.61:3838/skeletal-dysplasias/)). A tutorial supplementing our RSNA education exhibit can be found [here](code/skeletal-dysplasias.html).

### [Survival Distributions](http://104.131.159.61:3838/survival-curves/)
Plots of parametric survival distributions ([link](http://104.131.159.61:3838/survival-curves/)). Details on distributions used in R can be found [here](code/survival-distributions.html).
