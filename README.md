Hi there! Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal website [http://devinincerti.com/](http://devinincerti.com/).

The website is made with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub. 

My blog posts containing R code are created by converting Rmarkdown documents to markdown. This is done by running the script  `rmd2md.R`.

My CV is written using markdown and then converted to PDF and HTML using pandoc. This is done by running ./cv.sh.
