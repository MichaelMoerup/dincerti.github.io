Hi there! Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal website [http://devinincerti.com/](http://devinincerti.com/).

A PDF and HTML version of the CV is created by running ./cv.sh in the working directory of the website.

The Rmarkdown files are converted to markdown files by running the rmd2md.R.
